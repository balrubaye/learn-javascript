## Basics of JavaScript

This section provides an overview of the basic principles of JavaScript, which are crucial for understanding the more complex concepts covered later.

### JavaScript Syntax

The code in this folder covers the fundamentals of JavaScript syntax, including variables, operators, and expressions. To access the examples, navigate to the [JavaScript Syntax](./Basics%20of%20JavaScript/JavaScript%20Syntax) folder.

### JavaScript DataTypes

This section contains examples demonstrating JavaScript's dynamic typing feature and the different data types it supports. Visit the [JavaScript DataTypes](./Basics%20of%20JavaScript/JavaScript%20DataTypes) folder to see the code.

### Control Structures

Control structures dictate the flow of your program. Examples include if-else statements, switch cases, and loops. You can find these examples in the [Control Structures](./Basics%20of%20JavaScript/Control%20Structures) folder.

### Functions in JavaScript

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. This folder contains examples of function declarations, expressions, and built-in functions. Check out the examples in the [Functions in JavaScript](./Basics%20of%20JavaScript/Functions%20in%20JavaScript) folder.
